        <p>One of my favorite things is the outdoors. I love to travel, especially where I can hike and see nature. I also used to love to go backpacking but I have not gone for a long time.</p>

        <h1>Death Valley</h1>
        <p>On my most recent adventure, I went with my friends to Death Valley for a day on a weekend trip. It feels ironic to say that a desert is so beautiful, but we visited areas like the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, Harmony Borax Works, a stop at Furnace Creek, a drive down Artist's Drive, and finally looked at the stars at Badwater Basin.  The Mequite Flat Sand Dunes were beautiful because there were miles of sand that were untouched by man and had no footprints whatsoever, and the stars were beautiful at Badwater Basin which is also the lowest point in North America.  Here are some pictures, although I am not a photographer and the pictures do not capture the true beauty of the place.</p>
