        <p>Here are pictures of my Eagle Project. This was a significant project because it was large and demonstrated the culmination of my leadership experience from Boy Scouts.</p>

        <h1>Shinzen Gardens, Woodward Park</h1>
        <p>For my Eagle Project, I selected the beneficiary to be a Japanese Friendship Garden located in Woodward Park in Fresno, CA.  The garden was receiving a generous donation of the Clark Bonsai Collection, and was still having security issues where people were coming in and vandalizing the property, there were also some people that would just walk in and bypass the fees.  My project had two parts designed to improve the security and reduce people not paying the fees. The plan was to extend the existing fence and attach bamboo to prevent people from sneaking in. This might not completely prevent people from sneaking in, but should act as a deterant. Here are some pictures of the project site before the project.</p>

        <p>Part of the difficulty of the project was that the gardens was dedicating all funds for the new bonsai collection. This means that my project got no financial support from the beneficiary and that I would have to raise all of the money for the project. Furthermore, the original fence was made of redwood, not a cheap material. Thus, a lot of the planning process was contacting companies for discouts, and friends and family and other potential donators for donations.  Here are more pictures of the project and the final result.</p>
